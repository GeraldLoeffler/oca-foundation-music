#### Project 1: A Medieval Timeline

See my [History of Music timeline][Loeffler, 2019].

Instruments:

- Cornett: Wind instrument, conical, wood covered in leather, lips vibrate against cup-like mouthpiece, popular in Renaissance ([Wikipedia, 2005a]).
- Cornu: Translates simply as "horn"; G-shaped brass instrument of Roman origin ([Wikipedia, 2005b]).
- Lute: Plucked string instrument with neck, with or without frets, body round at back and flat at front ([Wikipedia, 2001b]).
- Rebec: Bowed string instrument, 1-5 strings, narrow body ([Wikipedia, 2002a]).

### Analytical Listening

- description
- volume
- tempo
- voice(s)
- instrument(s), sound(s)
- monophonic, polyphonic
- consonant, dissonant 
- text
- purpose
- emotions
- similarities 

### Notation

- pitched vs unpitched instruments
- bar, barlines
- notes and rests
- semibreve (1/1), minim (1/2), crotchet (1/4), quaver (1/8), semiquaver (1/16)
- dotted: +50%
- time signatures: quadruple time (4/4, four-four), triple time (3/4, three-four), duple time (2/4, two-four)
- beaming
- pitch
- octave
- stave, grand stave
- clefs: treble clef, bass clef
- tie
- slur

#### Time Signature Examples

- ‘Tritsch Tratsch Polka’ (Johann Strauss): 2/4 (also, a polka is typically in 2/4)
- ‘Sarabande in D minor’ HWV 437 (Handel): 3/4
- ‘The Sailor’s Hornpipe’ (Trad.): 2/4, but might as well be 4/4
- ‘We Will Rock You’ (Queen): 4/4
- ‘Feed the Birds’ (from Mary Poppins): 3/4
- ‘Finale from William Tell Overture’ (Rossini): 2/4, but heard as 4/4
- ‘Libertango’ (Astor Piazzolla): 4/4 (also, a tango is typically in 4/4)
- ‘The Times They Are A-Changin’ (Bob Dylan): 4/4
- ‘In the Hall of the Mountain King’ Op.46 (Grieg): 4/4

### Assignment 1: Replicating a Piano Piece Using Sibelius

Assignment 1 is available as a [Sibelius file](./files/assignment1.sib) and a [PDF](./files/assignment1.pdf).

This was painstakingly entered using Avid Sibelius 2019.5, using keyboard input as much as possible.

It's disappointing that some elements were not automatically positioned by Sibelius in their optimal location. Examples are:

- The "forte" expression in bar 7 appeared in bar 6, although it is associated with the 1st note in bar 7. I had to re-position it manually.
- The "Fine" in bar 8 appeared too much to the left, although it is associated with the end-repeat bar line and also right aligned. I had to manually move it to the right. Ditto for the "D.C. al Fine" in bar 20.
- The "decrescendo" starting in bar 17 had to be manually shifted to the left to visually start below its first note (the 2nd D in bar 17).

Other remarks:

- The quaver A in bar 12 is part of the slur that ends on that note, as well as being staccato: this seems like a contradiction.
- It seems like the mezzo piano in bar 9 belongs to the bass stave and not the treble stave, because in the original score it's closer to the former than the latter. But when i try to reproduce this in Sibelius then the "mp" shows up below the bass stave. So the closeness of the "mp" to the bass stave in the original score seems to be imagined or at least without meaning. But this begs the question: in a grand stave, is it possible to associate dynamics with either exclusively the bass stave, or exclusively the treble stave, or explicitly both staves? If so, what's the visual difference between the latter two notations?
